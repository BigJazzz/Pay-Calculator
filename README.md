# Pay Calculator
### This is an unofficial, unendorsed, privately-produced pay calculator for Sydney Trains Crew.

I am aiming to have this as accurate as possible, however due to the complexity of our pay conditions as well as payment periods, some data/amounts may be missing or wrong.

If you notice any issues with the calculations, have any questions, or want to make a suggestion please head to the the [issues page](https://github.com/BigJazzz/Pay-Calculator/issues).
